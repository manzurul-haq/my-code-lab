# My-Code-Lab 🧪

Welcome to my coding lab! This is a learning repository where I document my progress as a beginner web developer.

## 🎯 Current Focus:
Currently, I am focusing on **HTML**. My primary goals are:
* Mastering the core structure and semantics of HTML.
* Building a solid foundation before moving on to styling.

## 🚀 Roadmap:
- [x] HTML Structure & Semantics (In Progress)
- [ ] CSS Styling & Layouts (Coming Soon)
- [ ] JavaScript & Interactivity (Future Goal)

I will be updating this repository daily as I learn new concepts and build more projects. Step by step, I will add more technologies and languages to this lab.
